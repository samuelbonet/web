### Client/server communication process

The client server system is a model adaptable to the service we want to implement. This allows us to increase performance, such as wrapping multiple platforms, databases, networks, and operating systems that may be from different vendors with totally different architectures, and have them all work at the same time.

In addition, it can be considered an advantageous system in terms of security, since the server controls access to its data, that is, the server gives us permission to access it.
